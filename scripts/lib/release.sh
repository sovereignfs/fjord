# What every component's release has in common. Sourced by scripts/release.sh
# (and by its tests); not run directly.
#
# A component is a file in scripts/release/ that sets the C_* variables and
# defines the c_* functions below. This library does the parts that do not
# depend on what is being released: the output, the rollback, the changelog,
# the preflight, the waiting on GitHub. Why each check exists is in
# RELEASING.md and ROADMAP.md; every one of them is there because a release
# went wrong without it.
#
# How a release goes
# ------------------
# `main` takes changes only through a pull request (CLAUDE.md § Working
# conventions), and a release is a change like any other:
#
#   prepare  on a branch cut from main, bump, gate, and make one commit
#   propose  push that branch and open a draft pull request, then stop
#   ...      a person reviews the PR and merges it with "rebase and merge"
#   tag      on main, once merged: wait for CI on that exact commit, tag it,
#            watch the release workflow, retitle the release, verify it
#
# `tag` is separate from the merge because the merge rewrites the commit's
# SHA, and it is the merged commit that CI has to vouch for and that gets tagged.
#
# What a component provides
# -------------------------
#   C_PACKAGE            what the release is called in commit and tag messages
#   C_TAG_PREFIX         a release of version X is tagged "${C_TAG_PREFIX}X"
#   C_LEGACY_TAG_PREFIX  the prefix older releases were tagged with, if any;
#                        only used to find the previous release's tag
#   C_CHANGELOG          path of the component's CHANGELOG.md
#   C_TOUCHED            the files `prepare` edits (the changelog is one)
#   C_RELEASE_WORKFLOW   the workflow file that the tag starts
#   C_LATEST             "yes" if its releases are marked Latest on GitHub
#                        (the CLI's are: the install URLs say "latest"),
#                        "no" if they must never be
#   C_REQUIRED_WORKFLOWS workflows that must be green on the release commit
#   C_OPTIONAL_WORKFLOWS ...and ones that are only waited for if they ran
#
#   c_current_version    print the component's current version
#   c_check_versions     die unless every place a version is written agrees
#   c_bump FROM TO       write the new version everywhere, and refresh locks
#   c_check_plan V       die unless the release machinery accepts this tag
#   c_gates              run the checks that must pass before committing
#   c_verify V           check the published release
#   c_check_publish      (optional) die unless what publishing needs is in place;
#                        run before a pull request is proposed or a tag is pushed

# Always the repository root, whatever the caller's directory.
