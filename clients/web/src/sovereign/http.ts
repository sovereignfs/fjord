/**
 * The two notices Sovereign sends Fjord Web (DESIGN.md §17; core-app §3.6.5 and §4.5 in sovereignfs/sovereign), as the HTTP rules of
 * `POST /api/sovereign/backchannel-logout` and `POST /api/sovereign/account-deleted`. The route finds who may verify a notice and who acts on
 * it and hands them in, as `src/connections/http.ts` does, so every answer here is tested with stand-ins and each rule was seen to fail
 * with it switched off.
 *
 * The credential of these routes is the signed token and nothing else: there is no session, no cookie and no `Origin` (Sovereign's server
 * sends it), so a request is trusted exactly as far as `verify` trusts its token. What a verifier refuses is `400`, as Sovereign's contract
 * says; core being unreachable to check it is `503`; a failure of ours is `500`. Sovereign does not retry a logout notice and does retry a
 * deletion until it is answered `200`, with a new token each time, so a `5xx` for a deletion is how a failed one is made to run again.
 *
 * The route owns the HTTP and the verifier owns the token: this reads a bounded form body, takes the one field, and hands the verifier that
 * string. The route is public and the verifiers ask Sovereign for its keys, so a flood of junk would otherwise become a flood of requests to
 * it: the number of requests is capped (`NOTICE_RATE`, across all callers, since there are few honest ones), and a body bigger than a
 * token ever is, a form of another kind, or a token that is not there is refused before anything is asked of Sovereign.
 *
 * Nothing here logs the token, the person, or what went wrong beyond the kind of error.
