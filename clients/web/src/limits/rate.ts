/**
 * Rate limits (DESIGN.md §13, §15, ROADMAP 1d.4): at most `limit` of a kind of thing by one holder (an account, a link, a browser) in a window.
 * Counted in the database, as the sign-in limits are, so that the limit holds across every process and replica, and in a **fixed window**: the first
 * count starts a window of `windowMs`, the counts in it add up, and the first count after it starts the next. A holder can therefore do up to twice the
 * limit across the edge of two windows, which is the price of one statement per count and no history to keep.
 *
 * A count is made in one statement (insert, or update the row that is there), so that many at once cannot all be let through by each reading a count
 * that the others have not added to. A count that is refused still counts: asking again at once does not get nearer to being let in.
 *
 * The rules are the caller's; this knows nothing of comments.
